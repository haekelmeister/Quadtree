# Quadtrees
# Motivation
For one of my projects I needed a map who shows accumulated data. While digging the internet I found this
[famous tutorial](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-handle-large-amounts-of-data-on-maps). Unfortunately all the code is in Objective-C and thus it feels a bit outdated and odd. Because MapKit and Quadtrees where new to me at this time, I decided to "overhaul" the project and move it to Swift. Feel free to create pull request :)
